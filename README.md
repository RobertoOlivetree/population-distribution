# 🏙️ Population Distribution in Buildings Based on BGRI Data  

This repository contains scripts and data files for estimating and visualizing the **elderly population (65+) distribution in buildings** based on **BGRI statistical subsections** in Porto, Portugal. The project utilizes **Python, GeoPandas, Folium, and OSMnx** for spatial analysis and visualization.  

## 📌 Project Overview  

The goal of this project is to:  
- **Analyze the spatial distribution of the elderly population (65+) in buildings.**  
- **Compute population estimates per building based on BGRI statistical data.**  
- **Distribute the population proportionally to building areas.**  
- **Generate an interactive Folium map** showing population density per building.
